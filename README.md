# Teko

Teko is a programming language of an unusual sort - a statically typed scripting language. The plan is for Teko to be both interpreted and compiled, Ã  la Python; its interpretation-oriented organization and built-in types and data structures give it the ease of use of a scripting language like JS, Python, or Ruby, while its static typing and "functional-by-default" semantics will provide better safety and scalability.

**Major design features include:**

 * Static typing
 * The freedom of organization of a scripting language - put variable declarations, control blocks, or whatever you want right in the body of a file, no need to wrap it in a class or `main()`!
 * Zero type coercion - made up for with a variety of lightweight conversion syntax (`5$` means `5.to_str()`)
 * Everything is a method: e.g., `+` is *always* an alias for `.add()`; `3 + 4` *is* `(3).add(4)`
 * Everything is an expression - assignments and control blocks evaluate to a value
 * Out of the box data structures, including dynamic arrays, sets, maps, and algebraic data types
 * Elements of functional or functional-by-default style programming:
   * First-order functions and closures
   * Fastidiousness about mutability - mutable variables must be declared with the `var` keyword
   * Type inference - type may be omitted from declarations
   * Lightweight currying with ellipsis `..` syntax
 * Purely structural types
   * Objects can be created without a constructor, by simply listing all members
   * Class constructors are just syntactic sugar and you often don't need them - they're actually just functions!

## Installation

Make sure you have the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/dl/) installed.

Then, simply run 

```sh
go get github.com/cstuartroe/teko
```
